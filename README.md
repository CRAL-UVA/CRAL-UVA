### Platform Details

* **Clearpath Jackal:** A medium-sized, all-terrain mobile research platform. It is rugged, weatherproof, and **ROS-ready** for robust indoor and outdoor experimentation.
* **Traxxas Vehicles:** Cost-effective, high-speed platforms used for **scaled experiments** in control systems and motion planning, serving as a reliable testbed for agile navigation algorithms.

## 💻 Software Stack

We use **NVIDIA Isaac Sim/Isaac SDK** (referred to as **Isaac**) as our primary robotics simulation and development platform. Documentation and guides for Isaac integration will be added to the relevant robot documentation pages as they become available.
